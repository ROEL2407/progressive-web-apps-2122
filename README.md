## Where is this repository for?
This repository is for my lessons from the minor Web Development from the HvA. 

## What's the goal of this repository?
In this repository I've made a overview of art object from the Rijksmuseum. My goal of this repo is to learn JavaScript more and understand it a bit better.

## Usage
With this application you can look through some of the art objects Rijksmuseum has to offer. You can get more information about the pieces and make your own perspectives on it.

## Installation
Clone this repository to your own device:
```console
git clone https://github.com/ROEL2407/progressive-web-apps-2122.git
```

Use a local server to host the website. I use the Live server extension in Visual Studio Code to host.
